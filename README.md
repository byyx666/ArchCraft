# ArchCraft
Code for paper "Revisiting Neural Networks for Continual Learning: An Architectural Perspective"

First, select a continual learning scenario you are interested in. And then:

# To evaluate the performance of a given architecture

Run test.py


# To design a new architecture using ArchCraft

Make sure the value of 'is_running' in global.ini is 0, unless you want to continue the previous search process that was interrupted.

Then run evolve.py
